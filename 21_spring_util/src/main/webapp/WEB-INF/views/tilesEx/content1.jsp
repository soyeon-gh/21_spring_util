	<h2>over my head</h2>
	<pre>
		What happened to you
		You've played the victim for so long now in this game
		What I thought was true
		Is made of fiction and I'm following the same
		But if I try to make sense of this mess I'm in
		I'm not sure where I should begin
		I'm fallin' I'm fallin'
		Now I'm in over my head
		with something I said
		Completely misread
		I'm better off dead
		And now I can see
		How fake you can be
		This hypocrisy is beginning to get to me
		It's none of my concern
		Don't look to me because I don't believe in fame
		I guess you never heard
		I've met our makers they don't even know your name
		But if I had to say goodbye to leave this hell
		I'd say my time has served me well
		I'm fallin' I'm fallin'
		Now I'm in over my head
		with something I said
		Completely misread
		I'm better off dead
		And now I can see
		How fake you can be
		This hypocrisy is beginning to get to me
		This came long before
		Those who suffer more
		I'm too awake for this to be a nightmare
		What's with my disgrace
		I lost the human race
		No one plans for it to blow up in their face
		Who said it was easy to put back all these pieces
		Who said it was so easy to put back all of these pieces
		Now I'm in over my head
		with something I said
		Completely misread
		I'm better off dead
		And now I can see
		How fake you can be
		This hypocrisy is beginning to get to me
		Over my head Better off dead
		Over my head Better off dead
		Alright!
