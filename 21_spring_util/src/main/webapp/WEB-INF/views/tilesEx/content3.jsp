	<h2>move your body</h2>
	<pre>
		Poetry in your body
		You got it in every way
		And can't you see it's you I'm watching?
		I am hot for you in every way
		And turn around let me see you
		Wanna free you with my rhythm
		I know you can't get enough
		When I turn up with my rhythm
		Your body's poetry speak to me
		Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
		Move your body move your move your body
		I wanna feel you move to the music
		And let me be your rhythm tonight
		Move your body move your move your body
		Your body's poetry speak to me
		Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
		Move your body move your move your body
		I wanna feel you move to the music
		And let me be your rhythm tonight
		Move your body move your
		move your move your body
		Mo-mo-mo-mo-move your body
		Mo-mo-mo-mo-move your body
		Move your body
