	<h2> distance </h2>
	<pre>
		I heard you on the phone, I had you in mind
		I've been on the run since you walked through the hallway
		Heard it all before, I don't even mind
		I'll do anything, pull me in and I'm far away
		You're right there
		But I won't say that I'm standin'
		I'm right here, when I see you I panic
		So scared of the way it might pan out
		Well, I don't want to say that this was hard, it was
		Trying not to stay but that just made it worse
		I've been keepin' my distance
		Well, I just wanna know what you're thinking
		Oh, I just can't explain the way it hurts
		Now that what we had is gone
		I don't have the words, I'm so bad at playin' along
		I'm saving my feelings
		I've been keeping my distance
		I talked about it last night, thought I was fine
		Helped you pack your things, put your bags in the hallway
		Maybe in a past life, problems aside
		We could make it home, I'd hear you when you're callin'
		You're right there, yeah
		But I won't say that I'm standin'
		I'm right here, when I see you I panic
		I'm so scared of the way it might pan out
		Well, I don't want to say that this was hard, it was
		Trying not to stay but that just made it worse
		I've been keepin' my distance
		Well, I just wanna know what you're thinking
		I just can't explain the way it hurts
		Now that what we had is gone
		I don't have the words, I'm so bad at playin' along
		Saving my feelings
		I've been keeping my distance
		I've been feeling so high on the way down
		Hope I get another chance, 'cause I know I wouldn't
		Wouldn't let you pass by, wouldn't even think twice
		Let you out of my mind, I don't even know why
		I've been feeling so high on the way down
		Said you treated me bad, 'cause you know I couldn't
		Mmm, you know I couldn't
		I don't want to say that this was hard, it was
		Trying not to stay but that just made it worse
		I've been keepin' my distance
		I just wanna know what you're thinking
		I just can't explain the way it hurts
		Now that what we had is gone
		I don't have the words, I'm so bad at playin' along
		Saving my feelings
		I've been keeping my distance
